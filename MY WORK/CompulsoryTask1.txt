COMPULSORY TASK 1

1. 	Definitions
	a)	Data - Raw facts, such as a telephone number, customer name, or birth date. Generally has little meaning unless it has been organised. 
		A single character is the smallest piece of data that can be recognised by a computer as it only takes up 1 byte of space
	b) 	Field - A field is a character or group of characters that has a specific meaning. It is used to define and store data.
	c) 	Record - A record is a logically connect set of one or more fields that describes a person, place, or thing
	d) 	File - A file is a collection of related records

2) 	A DBMS is a 'Database Management System'. The advantages of a DBMS are as follows:
	- 	Better data sharing: makes it possible for end-users to have more efficient access to data that is better managed
	- 	Imporoved data integration: provides a clearer and more integrated view of the organisation's operations to the end-users
	- 	Minimised data inconsistency: properly designed databases greatlky reduce the probability of data inconsistency as data drawn from a variety of sources or end-users
	- 	Improved data access: A DBMS makes it possible to produce quick answers to spontaneous queries 
	- 	Improved decision making: better quality information is generated due to better-managed data and improved data access
	- 	Increased end-user productivity: encourages end-users to make quicker and more informed decisions

3)	The difference between data and information is that data are raw facts. It has not been processed to reveal its meaning and unless organised properley, 
	data generally has very little meaning. Information is used in decision making and is made with accurate and well organised data. It must be generated and
	stored properly so it is easy to access and understand.
	
4)	Metadata is data that describes the characteristics of other data.

5)	
	e)	The file contains 4 records
	f)	There are 4 fields per record
